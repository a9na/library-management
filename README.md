### 1.2 Document Conventions
This document follows the IEEE 830-1998 standard for software requirements specifications. It includes functional and non-functional requirements, along with system architecture and design constraints.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is intended for developers, designers, testers, and stakeholders working on the Library Management System project. It is recommended that readers familiarize themselves with the entire document to understand the system's requirements comprehensively.

### 1.4 Product Scope
The Library Management System will provide functionalities such as:
- Registering and managing library members.
- Managing library books and availability status.
- Facilitating borrowing and returning books.
- Providing search functionalities for books.
- Tracking overdue books and generating reports.

### 1.6 Overview
The LMS will be a web-based application that allows library staff and members to interact with the system for various purposes, including borrowing and returning books, managing member profiles, and searching the library’s catalog.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Library Management System will be a web application designed for library staff and members. It will have distinct user roles with different levels of access:
- **Reader:** Can view books and borrow them.
- **Librarian:** Can add books and manage their own borrowed books.
- **Administrator:** Can manage all users and books and access the admin dashboard.

The system will use a simple and intuitive interface with features that allow easy navigation for both staff and members.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
The LMS will have three primary user classes:
- **Reader:** Can view books and borrow them.
- **Librarian:** Can add books and manage their own borrowed books.
- **Administrator:** Can manage all users and books and access the admin dashboard.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The LMS will be a web application, hosted on a web server, and accessible via modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The application will be developed using the Django framework.
- The system will be scalable for future versions, possibly integrating more advanced features like cloud storage or distributed systems.

### 2.6 User Documentation
User manuals and help guides will be provided for both admins and members to ensure they can navigate the system easily.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The system will use Django’s default authentication system for managing user logins and access control.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 User Registration
**Req U1:** The system will allow new members to register by providing personal information (name, email, password). The system will verify the email is unique.

#### 3.1.2 User Login
**Req U2:** The system will allow users to log in with their email and password. The system will verify credentials and allow access to the dashboard.

#### 3.1.5 Borrowing and Returning Books
**Req U3:** Members will be able to borrow books. Upon borrowing, the system will update the book's availability status.

**Req U4:** Members will be able to return books. The system will track return dates and notify if books are overdue.

#### 3.1.6 Book Search
**Req U5:** The system will provide search functionality for books, allowing users to search by title, author, or category.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Usability
- The LMS will be designed for ease of use, with a simple interface for both admin and member users.
  
#### 3.2.2 Performance
- The system should load pages within 3 seconds to ensure a fast and responsive experience.

#### 3.2.3 Security
- The system will use HTTPS for secure communication.
- User passwords will be hashed and stored securely.

### 3.3 System Interfaces

#### 3.3.3 Communications Interfaces
The system will use secure HTTP (HTTPS) for communication between the reader and server.

## 4. Other Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Security
- All user data, including personal information and passwords, will be securely stored and transmitted.
  
### 4.2 Safety
- The application will be designed to prevent unsafe actions, such as allowing unauthorized users to modify or delete data.

### 4.3 Quality Attributes
- The system should have an uptime of at least 99% to ensure reliability and availability for users.

## 5. Conclusion
This document outlines the primary requirements for the Library Management System, focusing on both functional and non-functional aspects to ensure that the system meets user needs and provides a reliable, secure, and user-friendly platform for library management.
